# github-job-refactor

Now that we know how to create a solid architecture with Compound Components, and Styled.

Components, let's refactor an old project to practice our new skill.

We're going to refactor our Github Job architecture.

- User story: I can see a list of jobs in a city by default
- User story: I can search for jobs with a given keyword
- User story: I can search for jobs with a city name, zip code or other location
- User story: I can select one option from at least 4 pre-defined options
- User story: I can search for a full-time job only
- User story: I can see a list of jobs with their logo, company name, location, and posted time.
- User story: When I select a job, I can see job descriptions and how to apply like the given design.
- User story: When I am on the job details page, I can go back to the search page
- User story (optional): I can see a list of jobs in the closest city from my location by default
- User story (optional): I can see jobs in different pages, 5 items each page

- It's better to start a new project from scratch. You'll need to create a new repository by yourself.

- And the real first step is to analyse the app requirements and think about your components architecture, in terms of base components, containers and pages. Then, your folder architecture.

- This project is less technically complicated than the Netflix clone, so you should have less folders and components

- You have Friday, Saturday and Monday to complete the refactor.

- Don't underestimate the time you'll need to plan the architecture, so don't jump into the code too fast.

- You have Friday, Saturday and Monday to complete the refactor.


You’ll also have to apply a few concept we learned in class, such as a **reducer** and a global **context**. And there will be a bonus for those who can find a use case for a **compound component**.

**Icon**: https://google.github.io/material-design-icons/ (you can also use the react-icons package)

**API**: https://jobs.github.com/api. Use data from the API to create questions and answers.

*If you get some CORS errors, you can use https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/ to help with accessing data from other websites that are normally forbidden by the same-origin policy of web browsers*

**Design** : https://www.figma.com/file/gAkVx9CdOqnJcCjJ7nVNkw

**Live app** : https://jolly-heisenberg-20c49e.netlify.app/

Once you completed, polish a nice readme submit your solutions on this link : https://forms.gle/Xg6kJMKmrBkyTe3TA, by providing URLs for both GitHub repository and live app on Netlify.

For the custom domain url you'll enter in netlify, please use the following naming convention : **github-jobs-_YOUR_FIRSTNAME_.netlify.app** (replace YOUR_FIRSTNAME by your firstname)

Good luck everybody!

Template for your readme :

<!-- Please update value in the {}  -->

<h1 align="center">{Your project name}</h1>

<div align="center">
  <h3>
    <a href="https://{your-demo-link.your-domain}">
      Demo
    </a>
    <span> | </span>
    <a href="https://{your-url-to-the-solution}">
      Solution
    </a>
  </h3>
</div>
